## suspension

You do not need to take the shock off to adjust. Loosen the top tank bolts & remove the bottom. Lift up the tank. Spray the shock threads with WD40 before moving the adjuster ring. The threads gald easy.

## sag

- [set sag by yourself](https://www.southbayriders.com/forums/threads/159177/)
- [setting sag & adjusting ride](http://690enduro.createaforum.com/suspension/setting-sag-and-adjusting-ride/)

static sag (bike only) should be 10% +/- of travel
riding sag (rider & gear on bike) should be 30% +/- of travel

## valves

A few thoughts:

- A small amount of side play is normal for the rockers.
- The clearances will most definitely change with new rockers.
- You either buy a kit (as mentioned above) and then swap shims as needed, or you take it all apart, figure out the exact sizes you need and then swap yours for new ones at the dealer (measure accurately or you get to do another trip...)
- Check the valves when the engine is dead-cold and with the all the rocker arm bolts torqued to spec.
- Use a torque wrench during reassembly...
- Exhaust valves generally get tighter as the engine is run-in.
- Intake valves should do the same but at a lesser rate.
- If you see things starting to loosen up, then you most likely are having a bearing issue and a new rocker will be required - along with new shims, possibly smaller than what is currently installed. So that leads to carrying a micrometer unless you are extremely well organized about what shim you have installed in each location and all your spare shims marked (and packed in a way that won't allow the markings to be rubbed off).
- Walk through the process of calculating new shim sizes before you're in some hut in the middle of no where.

Continuing that thought - when you check your valve clearances look for:

- any movement of the pin in the bearing
- increased radial and axial play in the bearing
- galling, marks, or a noticeable change in the surface finish of the bearing and/or cam lobe
- rapid change in clearances of one valve
- difficulty turning over the engine when starting (can be a sign of tight valves)
- changes in the sound of the engine while idling or accelerating

## [original listing](http://advrider.com/index.php?threads/2010-ktm-690-enduro-r.1259399/)

Located in Brooklyn, NY. I'm asking $7500. I've had a great time with this bike
and it's everything I expected and more. If I could only have one bike, it would
be this one. I put half of the 16,000 miles on it. Last year I was riding in
Colorado and I broke a piston ring. I decided to replace the top end with a
lower mileage one and also installed new piston/rings/gaskets. I also upgraded
the rocker arms to the newest versions. The front and rear suspension were
rebuilt 500 miles ago by Enduro Spec in CO. The rear was re-sprung for 210lbs
(rider+gear) and the front was rebuilt with heavy duty seals. Valves were just
adjusted and oil/filters/screens renewed. All fluids are Motorex. The cooling
system was just flushed and renewed with engine ice. This bike is very clean,
runs great, and has no issues.

Upgrades:

- Wings Exhaust
- Rade Auxillary fuel tank
- Pod foam filter with pre filter
- Seat Concepts low seat
- Pivot Pegs
- Touratech Rear rack
- Wolfman pannier racks with passenger pegs
- Rally Raid radiator guard
- Rally Raid upper and lower tank mounts
- CJ Designs fuel cap
- Flatland racing skid plate
- Kouba lowering link (5/8")
- BRP Sub mount with Scotts Steering Stabilizer
- Enduro Engineering Hand Guards
- Heated Grips
- G2 Quick Throttle
- Fuze Block
- USB Outlet
- Auxillary fan switch
- Double Take Mirrors with RAM Mounts
- Accessory windscreen
- New rear rotor
- New clutch master cylinder
- MT21 front with 50% tread
- D606 with 70% tread
- Extra rocker arms
- Extra levers
- Factory manual and tool kit

That's most of it. Feel free to ask questions.
