Located in Brooklyn, NY. I'm asking $7500. I've had a great time with this bike
and it's everything I expected and more. If I could only have one bike, it would
be this one. I put half of the 16,000 miles on it. Last year I was riding in
Colorado and I broke a piston ring. I decided to replace the top end with a
lower mileage one and also installed new piston/rings/gaskets. I also upgraded
the rocker arms to the newest versions. The front and rear suspension were
rebuilt 500 miles ago by Enduro Spec in CO. The rear was re-sprung for 210lbs
(rider+gear) and the front was rebuilt with heavy duty seals. Valves were just
adjusted and oil/filters/screens renewed. All fluids are Motorex. The cooling
system was just flushed and renewed with engine ice. This bike is very clean,
runs great, and has no issues.

Upgrades:

- Wings Exhaust
- Rade Auxillary fuel tank
- Pod foam filter with pre filter
- Seat Concepts low seat
- Pivot Pegs
- Touratech Rear rack
- Wolfman pannier racks with passenger pegs
- Rally Raid radiator guard
- Rally Raid upper and lower tank mounts
- CJ Designs fuel cap
- Flatland racing skid plate
- Kouba lowering link (5/8")
- BRP Sub mount with Scotts Steering Stabilizer
- Enduro Engineering Hand Guards
- Heated Grips
- G2 Quick Throttle
- Fuze Block
- USB Outlet
- Auxillary fan switch
- Double Take Mirrors with RAM Mounts
- Accessory windscreen
- New rear rotor
- New clutch master cylinder
- MT21 front with 50% tread
- D606 with 70% tread
- Extra rocker arms
- Extra levers
- Factory manual and tool kit

That's most of it. Feel free to ask questions.
