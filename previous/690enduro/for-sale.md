2010 KTM 690 Enduro R - 28,000 miles - \$5,000 - Brooklyn NY 11231

Located in Brooklyn, NY. I'm asking \$5,000. I've had an amazing time with this
bike, but it's time to trim the stable back a bit. It has been well maintained
throughout its life, and I have maintenance logs and receipts for work
done/upgrades.

Oil (always Motorex) just changed, Scott's stainless steel filters cleaned, and
fresh air filter put in. Fresh rocker arms (updated version) were installed
(only as a precaution) 500 miles ago and the valves were reshimmed. All are
within spec. Cooling system was also flushed and renewed with Engine Ice at
that time. Brake and clutch fluid were also topped off. A new throttle cable
and new chain were also installed within the last 700 miles.

The previous owner rebuilt the top end after breaking a piston ring at 15,000
miles - I have paperwork from the rebuild - and I've had zero issues with the
engine in the 13k miles I've put on the bike since purchasing it. This machine
has a long life ahead of it.

This bike is very clean, runs great, and has no issues. I wouldn't hesitate to
ride the TAT with it tomorrow.

I also have a Mosko Moto Reckless 80 luggage system that I'd be willing to
throw in with the right offer. It fits perfectly on the Perun racks and heel
guards.
