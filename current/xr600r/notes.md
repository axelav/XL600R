## email conversation with Jonah

That's some serious lighting on that XR.

Try lubing the brake and throttle cables before replacing them. It makes a
huge difference and that might be all they need. There's a special little
tool you can get for $8 called a cable lubing too. It's made to force the
lube from the straw into the cable housing.

As far as lighting and stator and wiring goes, I would first think about
how much light output you really need and the type of riding you'll do with
it. For around the city, you barely need any light... just enough to pass
inspection and be seen by oncoming cars. Otherwise, the streets are lit by
the street lamps. You only need powerful lighting if you'll be out in the
countryside, night riding on back roads. Even then, you can get a lot of
lumens now with very cheap LED lights. So, I doubt you'll need to upgrade
the stator. The stator on that XR was made to power at least front and rear
conventional incandescent bulbs and that's way more consumption than a
whole bunch of LEDs. So, I would try it as is before upgrading stators. As
far as converting AC to DC, I forget how the set up goes and I'll have to
research that too in the next couple months as I work on this KDX. Below is
a diagram I found for the KDX and I would think it applies to any bike.
Adding blinkers and a horn would just be additional wires off the switch. I
think all you need is a reg/rect. Even a battery is optional but I would
add one so you can pass inspection and leave lights on in case you stall
out on a busy highway with no shoulder or something light that. If you end
up figuring out this lighting thing first, let me know how you did it! I'll
probably try to make my own battery this time around but if you're looking
for a good ready-made battery, I used a Moty Designs battery in my DRZ.
It's very small and light weight. I stuck it in my air box.

Yeah, I should have this KDX ready for the spring so let's try the barrens!
